## üìä Backup Slides/Talking Points

### If Asked: "How do you make money?"
"Four revenue streams:
1. Wearable device: $149 one-time
2. Premium subscription: $14.99/month
3. Transaction fees: 2.9% on card payments
4. Future: B2B data services

Year 1 target: $582K with 10K users."

### If Asked: "What's your moat?"
"Three defensible advantages:
1. Emotion tracking technology (no one else has this)
2. Integrated platform (hard to replicate 100+ features)
3. Freelancer-specific data (valuable for B2B services)"

### If Asked: "Why not just use QuickBooks + Robinhood?"
"That's exactly the problem‚Äîfragmented tools. Freelancers spend 10+ hours per month switching between apps. Our AI knows your complete picture. Our emotion tracker works across everything. One login, one platform, one financial truth."
